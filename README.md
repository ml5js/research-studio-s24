# Topics in ITP: Contributing to ml5.js (Research)

This course is a studio-oriented seminar where students will actively participate in the evolution of the ml5.js open source project. The structure of this course is inspired by initiatives such as the Processing Foundation Fellowship and Google Summer of Code.

This is a research course, which is different structures compared to normal courses. The class offers a structure and resources for your own research, as opposed to a more typical curriculum.

The academic requirement for this class is a documention of your research. The final project for the class is a "research report" documenting and summarizing your work over the form of the semester.

## Final Documentation Guidelines

It is expected that the format and style of the project documentation will vary considerably based on the specifics of each unique project in this class! The main requirement is to link to written documentation (in the form of a blog post, webpage, github markdown file added to this repo, or other online platform). Additionally, you should prepare a concise slide presentation for the final class on April 17th. You'll have about 8 minutes to present, followed by approximately 5 minutes for questions and feedback.

Here is a guide to how you might structure your documentation and presentation.

### Abstract

- Briefly describe your project: What it is, its goals, how you approached it, and the impact you anticipate it will have. Keep it within ~200-250 words.

### Background and Objectives

- Explain the motivation behind your project and its objectives.
- Detail how your work aligns with and contributes to the ml5.js project or the broader field of creative media arts.

### Process and Methodology

- Outline the methods and approaches you employed.
- List the tools and technologies you used.
- Discuss any community engagement or user testing undertaken.
- Share challenges encountered.

### Final Results

- Describe the outcome of your project. What form does your final work take?

### Future Directions

- Reflect on any new questions or challenges that emerged.
- Share your key takeaways and where you see this project going in the future.

### References

- List and summarize the key references, literature, or projects that informed your work.

## Statement of Academic Integrity

Plagiarism is presenting someone else’s work as though it were your own. More specifically, plagiarism is to present as your own: A sequence of words quoted without quotation marks from another writer or a paraphrased passage from another writer’s work or facts, ideas or images composed by someone else.

## Statement of Principle

The core of the educational experience at the Tisch School of the Arts is the creation of original academic and artistic work by students for the critical review of faculty members. It is therefore of the utmost importance that students at all times provide their instructors with an accurate sense of their current abilities and knowledge in order to receive appropriate constructive criticism and advice. Any attempt to evade that essential, transparent transaction between instructor and student through plagiarism or cheating is educationally self-defeating and a grave violation of Tisch School of the Arts community standards. For all the details on plagiarism, please refer to page 10 of the Tisch School of the Arts, Policies and Procedures Handbook, which can be found online at: http://students.tisch.nyu.edu/page/home.html

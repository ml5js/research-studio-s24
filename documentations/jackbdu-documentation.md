# Machine Learning Tutorials for Absolute Beginners - Progress Report

## Background and Objectives

With the ongoing development of [ml5-next-gen](https://github.com/ml5js/ml5-next-gen) (ml5.js 1.0 has launched now, woohoo!), I thought there was no better time to create a series of beginner-friendly tutorials for those interested in learning machine learning for the first time. This project aims to provide a gateway for individuals to start their journey in both programming and machine learning. Read [my original proposal](../projects/jackbdu-proposal.md) and [final presentation slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vYD5JoWNRzSN9LOsUjIqImMu4WhSHr9Q/) to learn more.

## Process and Methodology

During my research, I actively engaged in creative experimentation (such as [this interactive melody painter using ml5.handPose](https://www.instagram.com/p/C4WozrtsZ4r/) and [this mouth-controlled FM synthesizer using ml5.faceMesh](https://www.instagram.com/p/C41i1VQsfs0/)) with the ml5.js library, which deepened my appreciation of its accessibility and the creative possibilities it offers. I also studied the source code of ml5.js and its underlying TensorFlow.js library, along with articles and papers related to their development. This has given me a more holistic understranding of how ml5.js functions and how TensorFlow.js models are trained.

## Current Progress

Initially, I began drafting [written tutorials](https://github.com/jackbdu/ml5-tutorials) but later shifted my focus towards preparing for an [undergraduate machine learning course](https://github.com/jackbdu/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-Summer24) that I would be teaching over the summer. The well-structured and detailed [syllabus](https://github.com/ml5js/Intro-ML-Arts-IMA-F23) Dan Shiffman and Yining Shi developed and shared with me was instrumental in this process. Teaching the course prompted me to reconsider my tutorial strategy. Rather than duplicating the content that is already comphrehensively covered in Dan's video tutorials, I plan to focus on developing beginner-friendly code examples that use ml5.js in playful or unexpected ways. Additionally, I plan to create project-oriented tutorials that demonstrate the entire development process of some of my ml5.js experiments from start to finish. I have observed that my students learn most effectively through examples that I have created, so I believe producing more examples will be highly beneficial for learners exploring ml5.js.

## Future Directions

I intend to adpot an iterative approach, continously refining my tutorials and my teaching strategies as I gather feedback from learners and my peers.
